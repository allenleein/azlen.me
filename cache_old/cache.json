I'm not following any specific learning path (textbook, HSK, etc.) but probably know, recognize, and can write maybe a few hundred characters and words. My approach to learning is focused on learning both spoken and written language simultaneously because I am particularly fascinated by characters and how they combine in different ways. In addition, learning to read and write creates a plethora of connections which only help to reinforce memory of spoken language as well."}, {"type": "text", "text": [["If you are at a different stage of learning or have a very different learning approach, don't worry I'm sure we can still find ways with which to learn together."]], "rawtext": "If you are at a different stage of learning or have a very different learning approach, don't worry I'm sure we can still find ways with which to learn together."}], "wordcount": 260, "flags": {"new": false, "updated": false}}, "468764ab-026e-40fc-b093-e60ac682750a": {"id": "468764ab-026e-40fc-b093-e60ac682750a", "version": 249, "template": null, "published": true, "description": "Reimagining how we learn and collaborate online", "cover": ["/images/future_of_learning_cover.png"], "permalink": "", "name": "Future of Learning", "path": "/learn/future_of_learning", "children": [{"type": "image", "image_source": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/502d7575-c372-4622-9ebe-4a93a59f2944/Future_of_Learning.png", "image_name": "b95d69fc-1a96-4951-8b77-1ecd1f5c6488.png", "image_path": "/images/b95d69fc-1a96-4951-8b77-1ecd1f5c6488.png"}, {"type": "text", "text": [["The internet is so vast, with endless resources, websites, courses, and sources of information to learn from\u2014but few good platforms to connect small groups of people to learn together.
