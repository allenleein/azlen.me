            <p><span>1. Teaching each other <ul><li>A small group of people gather around a topic to learn together. They decide as a group on directions or projects, do their own research and come back to the group to teach their peers about their findings. Teaching others is an effective way of identifying and correcting gaps in your own knowledge (similar to Feynman Technique)</li></ul></span></p>
        
            <p><span>2. Teaching an audience<ul><li>Gathering your insights, key ideas, and projects into some form of documentation and releasing it out into the world. Just as teaching others is beneficial to individual learning, condensing insights for others is beneficial to communal learning.</li><li>I think of this as creating an artifact, </li></ul></span></p>
        
            <p><span>3. Wider discussion<ul><li>The final artifact produced by one cohort serves as a launching pad for future cohorts, this creates a wider discussion</li></ul></span></p>
