        <h1>Public space is the intersection between belonging and openness</h1>
        
            <p><span><a class="internal" data-uuid="aH7sHrdJ" href="/aH7sHrdJ">There are many different kinds of public space</a> which script our behaviour in different ways. In trying to formulate a definition of what makes a public space I have come across two key ideas: belonging and openness.</span></p>

            <p><span>Belonging is how welcome you feel being in the space, everyone might feel different levels of belonging in public spaces and it can be important to ask who might not feel welcome in the public spaces of our cities. Belonging is also about how comfortable you feel with a range of different activities, sidewalks allow for a small range of activities due to their narrow width (walking, running) but I might not feel that I belong if I sit down on the sidewalk because it is not meant for this type of interaction and I will be in other people's way.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>Openness is about both  physical openness (expansive, larger area) and also about social openness which is more difficult to quantify. Social openness can also change over time or based on culture and normal methods of interacting with a space in one part of the world (sitting on grass for example) might be frowned upon in another part of the world. Hidden racism or fear of the other—even if not vocalized—can impact how open a public space feels to other people and who you're willing to 'accept' into the area.</span></p>
