        <h1>Self-learning podcast</h1>
        
            <p><span>This is a rough idea that I am currently experimenting with. The basic idea is that as you learn a topic you also record yourself trying to teach yourself what you have learnt. On-top of being a mechanism to focus, this recording can also serve as a kind of spaced-repetitionâ€”you can later listen through your recordings to refresh your knowledge and perhaps even refine your own descriptions.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>Inspired by the <a class="external" href="https://educationbookcast.libsyn.com/" target="_blank">Education Bookcast</a> where each episode discusses key learnings and ideas from different books around education and psychology. Whether you are trying to make sense of different research papers or learning a language, creating your own personal podcast can be a very interesting approach to learning.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>I'm currently using this technique to learn to write Chinese characters, which is very interesting because it involves transforming between visual and auditory information. For each character I will describe what it looks like and the strokes/components that are part of it, then its pronunciation and what it means, often I will also look through a few common words it is part of to get a better overall sense of the character. It is slow, perhaps 2 - 3 minutes per character/radical but <a class="internal" data-uuid="bmYYs9ca" href="/bmYYs9ca">The rate of learning is roughly proportional to the rate of forgetting</a>, and so by taking your time with each you will likely remember for much longer after a single exposure.</span></p>
