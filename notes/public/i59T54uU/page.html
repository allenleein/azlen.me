            <p><span>As someone who is often working on multiple projects at once, I often wonder how endeavours which appear quite disparate might be tied together by a single thread, goal, or motivation. Through this self-reflection, I have slowly been able to learn more about myself and piece together a better conception of my own long-term goals and interests. My projects generally stem from three ‘pillars’ of interest: the <strong>mind</strong>, <strong>city</strong>, and <strong>education</strong>.</span></p>
        
            <p><span><strong>Mind</strong> : I want to explore how the mind works and develop tools to think and learn more effectively.<ul><li>How can I use existing mnemonic techniques or invent new ones to remember more effectively?</li><li>Hammers are one of many tools to manipulate physical matter, but what tools could exist in our <em>mental toolbox</em> to manipulate thoughts or ideas?</li></ul></span></p>
        
            <p><span><strong>City</strong> : I want to imagine and build the cities of the future.<ul><li>How can cities be better designed to foster community and participation?</li><li>In what ways do cities affect us psychologically?</li></ul></span></p>
        
            <p><span><strong>Education</strong> : I want to create new mediums, platforms, or opportunities for learning.<ul><li>Instead of how MOOCs try to replicate university lectures but at a collosal and impersonal scale, how can we make online education more personal and niche to individual interests? The internet is a perfect platform to connect small groups of motivated people around a common interest or niche area of study.</li><li>Are there ways to improve on the design of forums or video calls to create more comfortable online spaces for learning and collaboration?</li></ul></span></p>
