            <p><span>Andy mentions that <a class="external" href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6DCZK1JtHU3waXWTk5UbNt3kXU4WRT9EwNND" target="_blank">Most games aren’t enabling environments</a> which I find interesting because <a class="internal" data-uuid="mGB7thFQ" href="/mGB7thFQ">Games are inherently engaging mediums</a>. But not all engaging mediums are enabling environments. Thinking back to <a class="internal" data-uuid="V42qDrst" href="/V42qDrst">Three engagement factors</a>, a common pattern across the examples is the environment of curiosity: enabling environments provide a space and tools to navigate that space towards your own personal goals (and not the goals that the environment places upon you like in games or school)</span></p>
        
            <p><span><h1>Examples</h1><ul><li><h1>Schools provide the goal of grades and the space of lectures, worksheets, and projects, but the goal of maximizing grades is not truly meaningful. This makes school a puzzle to achieve a goal that is not personally meaningful.</h1></li><li><h1>Y Combinator provides the space and tools. Network of people, access to investors, events, time to work on your project, investing.</h1></li><li><h1>Most games provide a goal, space, and tools and act as a sort of enabling sub-environment because they do "expand participants' capacity to do things they find meaningful and important" but those things are what the game _wants_ you to find meaningful and are not meaningful personally.</h1></li><li><h1>Great software (e.g Photoshop) gives you a canvas on which to work on and tools to manipulate that canvas. Allowing you to pursue your own goals, or formulate new goals in this environment.</h1></li><li><h1>Densely-connected evergreen notes build a space along with the tools of navigating and interlinking ideas which help to formulate new goals. The tools of connected notes are more nuanced and externalized (not stuck inside your mind) than regular note-taking which is what makes this a stronger enabling environment.</h1></li><li><h1>Minecraft was the first example I came up with for curiosity: the intersection between tools and space. The combination of these engages you towards creating your own goals and is one of the most productive and enabling forms of engagement.</h1></li></ul></span></p>

                <p class="backlink-title">Artifacts might not be the right framing for collective output</p>
                <p class="backlink-text">Also the idea of an "artifact" gives the sense that the output must be perfectly polished, while really my goal is not the final outcome but the process that it takes to get there. For a typical learning group with divergent goals, you should focus instead on providing the space (information and material) and verbs (processes and interactions) to create an Enabling environment for people to work towards more polished output and ideas.</p>

                <p class="backlink-text">When the goals of a group diverge then the focus on engagement should be on the two factors out of my Three engagement factors, namely: <strong>space</strong> (the information and materials), and <strong>verbs</strong> (processes and interactions). The combination of these two factors create an approach to engagement that I call "curiosity," but may also be considered to be an Enabling environment. Perhaps I would call this kind of learning group a <strong>thinking group</strong>.</p>
