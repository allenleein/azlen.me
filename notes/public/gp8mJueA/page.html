        <h1>Dunbar's number(s) for study groups and learning communities</h1>
        
            <p><span>Question brought up by <a class="external" href="http://reganmian.net/blog/about-me/" target="_blank">Stian Håklev</a> (1)</span></p>
        
            <p><span><blockquote>What are the relative "dunbar's number(s)" for study groups and learning communities? How many levels do we need from small meaningful discussion > collective note groups > whole "imagined communities",</blockquote></span></p>
        
            <p><span>Some considerations:<ul><li>Small group (4 people) is sufficient to create productive discussion and give participants the obligation to show up as each person makes up a large percentage of the group</li><li>Medium-sized groups (7-12 people) may result in some participants not participating in the discussion. This may in part be due to the platform and typical lack of structure in this groups? (see: <a class="internal" data-uuid="TvzbWv3g" href="/TvzbWv3g">Structured conversation can create more effective synchronous meetings</a>)</li><li>Large groups (15 - 45 people) are too large for everyone's voices to be heard but can benefit more from breakout groups and asynchronous discussions</li><li>Massive groups (100 - 10,000+) can sometimes be too large for very generative asynchronous discussions and may need to be broken down into smaller groups where you can be familiar with all the participants. These small groups may then be able to bubble up their best ideas to take part in a larger discussion</li></ul></span></p>
