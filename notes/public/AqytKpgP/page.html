                <p class="backlink-text">This collective production of an artifact enables two psychological frames of peer-learning based on the idea that Teaching a topic deepens your own knowledge that topic. First you learn deeper by teaching your peer, but also you collectively learn deeper by teaching those who follow in your footsteps. Class artifacts can serve as a launchpad for future cohorts.</p>
