        <h1>Heterotopia</h1>
        
            <p><span>If a utopia is a place that is good, and a dystopia is a place that is bad, a heterotopia is a place that is different.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>I would describe a heterotopia as a <em>place of mind</em>, it is a place with a shared mental model different than that of the regular world. Designing a heterotopia goes beyond architecting space but in creating a shared experience.</span></p>
