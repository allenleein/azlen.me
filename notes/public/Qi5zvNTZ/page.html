        <h1>Conceptual space is like a landscape</h1>
        
            <p><span>I like to imagine concepts and ideas existing on a mental landscape. Knowing a fact, without knowing reasoning or implications of that fact is like a point floating in space; only when you understand something deeply does it begin to form part of your mental landscape.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>When memorizing or learning, a conceptual landscape helps to give context and a place to position memories within your mind. If everything you memorize is not connected to a deeper understanding, it is just points floating in space. I think this is why people often have difficulty learning a foreign language if they are focused on memorizing word lists, they do not spend time building up their conceptual landscape of representation.</span></p>

                <p class="backlink-text">When taking notes, a process I have began to just write key words and terms on the page. Then as I take notes, begin to connect some of these terms, find the bridges between them, think how does X affect Y. Conceptual space is like a landscape, and this process helps build the landscape on which to remember some of the more finer-grained details. </p>

                <p class="backlink-title">Asking "why?" gets to the heart of an idea</p>
                <p class="backlink-text">"Why?" is one of the most powerful questions in my toolbelt of Mental acrobatics. Asking why forces you to question what you know and connect to broader contexts within your mind. If you imagine Conceptual space is like a landscape, this question can help explore the roots and landscape surrounding an idea and help to discover the deeper, more fundamental meanings underlying that idea.</p>

                <p class="backlink-text">New ideas are formed by combining and linking together existing ideas. These intersections and connections open not only develop your conceptual landscape (Conceptual space is like a landscape), but it can bring you to explore new areas of thought.</p>

                <p class="backlink-text">Trying to teach a topic forces you to deeply understand that topic yourself and makes you realize any gaps you might have in your own knowledge. Because of this, teaching is actually a very good learning activity because it requires not simply having a grasp of facts but really understanding the landscape of knowledge.</p>
