        <h1>Δ Psychocivic framework for thought</h1>
        
            <p><span>Our cities affect our psychology. Exactly in what ways living in cities affects our mind and behaviour however is not clear. I think that we do not have a good mental framework for thinking about the psychological effects of cities so I have designed what I call the psychocivic framework for thought. <a class="internal" data-uuid="FnSofJVE" href="/FnSofJVE">A framework for structuring thought is also a framework for asking good questions</a>.</span></p>

            <p><span>The psychocivic framework for thought is made up of 4 parts:<ul><li>Function: The systems which enable urban spaces to exist</li><li>Space: Indoor, outdoor, and digital layers of the city</li><li>Experience: Sensory experience of the space</li><li>Psyche: Anything relating to the mind</li></ul></span></p>
        
            <p><span>The goal is that by using this framework to structure any thinking around cities, the psychological effects and phenomena may be observed more closely. This model puts our internal experience as a high priority in thinking about the design of the space and systems of a city.</span></p>

                <p class="backlink-text">The goal of my Δ Psychocivic framework for thought was to design a new way to think about the design and architecture of cities through a psychological perspective, and in designing a framework for thinking about the psychology of cities, it has also become a framework for asking pertinent questions. </p>

                <p class="backlink-text">I think first of my Δ Psychocivic framework for thought, however perhaps this framework itself can be improved. For example, I do not have much of a consideration for time. As well it requires connecting the dots, it does not achieve the simplicity of some mental frameworks or lenses with which to look upon the world.</p>
