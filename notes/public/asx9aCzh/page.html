        <h1>Learn with me</h1>
        
            <p><span>I've noticed many personal websites which have <code>/learning</code> pages where they describe the things that they are currently learning. Even I have <a class="external" href="https://azlen.me/learning/" target="_blank">my own learning page</a>, despite not updating it frequently. But what is the purpose of these pages? personally my website is partially a discovery mechanism for people who are interested in similar topics as I am. Sometimes people reach out to me saying they found X or Y interesting and want to chat further.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>Following a conversation with Nibras I began reflecting on these <code>/learning</code> and thinking about reframing them as "learn with me" pages where instead of being a comprehensive page of what I am learning, it is more of a participatory schedule. Maybe each Monday at 3pm I'll be doing research on a specific topic, my "learn with me" page would be an invitation for you to come join me and form a small learning group together.</span></p>
