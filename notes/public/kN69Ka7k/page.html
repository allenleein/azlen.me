            <p><span>In circling around the question "what is engagement?" I have come up with <a class="internal" data-uuid="nJHwBEjP" href="/nJHwBEjP">Three approaches to engagement</a> which are each formed of two out of <a class="internal" data-uuid="V42qDrst" href="/V42qDrst">Three engagement factors</a>: goal, space, or verb. I further hypothesise that these three approaches to engagement come together to form a cycle of engagement which underlies not only why <a class="internal" data-uuid="mGB7thFQ" href="/mGB7thFQ">Games are inherently engaging mediums</a> but also any creative work. Further, I believe that <a class="internal private" href="#">Deliberate Practice for Knowledge Work is a [[Cycle of Engagement</a>]]</span></p>

                <p class="backlink-text">This same Cycle of Engagement can be applied to just about any creative endeavour or engaging experience. It even draws parallels with how we experience and learn about the world: gathering information to build a mental model of the world, experimenting with pushing the boundaries of this mental model, and then reflecting and updating this model.</p>

                <p class="backlink-text">The fundamental principle of gamification is that Games are inherently engaging mediums. The goal is engagement, so my thoughts on the Cycle of Engagement are relevant to this broader conceptualisation of gamification.</p>
