        <h1>The internet lacks platforms for bringing people together to learn collectively</h1>
        
            <p><span>Boundless are the number of learning platforms and MOOCs offered by universities but <a class="internal" data-uuid="WEPsTLTV" href="/WEPsTLTV">MOOCs fail to engage students</a> and are generally taken alone without much sense of community or peer-interaction. There are few platforms which bring people together to learn or work on a problem collectively. <a class="external" href="https://complice.co/" target="_blank">Complice</a> tackles accountability with silent coworking rooms, but is not a binding agent bringing people together around a single task or topic but rather a catalyst for each person's individual goals and projects.</span></p>

                <p class="backlink-text">Learning groups, peer-to-peer courses, and course co-laboratories are all terms for the same idea of bringing people together to learn. The internet is full of endless resources to learn from alone, but The internet lacks platforms for bringing people together to learn collectively. A place where students learn and bring what they've learnt back to teach the group (Teaching is an effective to learn material and identify weak areas of knowledge), and where they can share resources with the group.</p>
