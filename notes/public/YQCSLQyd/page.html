                <p class="backlink-title">The internet should facilitate chance encounters</p>
                <p class="backlink-text">Perhaps a better approach would be to facilitate chance encounters on the quiet side-streets of the internet. If you're heading somewhere, you might bump into someone somewhere along the path. On the internet, you navigate the city through search, so this would be the ideal place to bump into friends and people in your network. By facilitating chance encounters, Search could be a social experience.</p>
