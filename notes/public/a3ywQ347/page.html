        <h1>Gamification application: language learning</h1>
        
            <p><span>For the most part I am generally opposed to the idea of <em>gamification</em>. This stems perhaps from a lack of creativity in how gamification is used in practice, focusing primarily on gimmicky points systems and extrinsic motivators.</span></p>

How can there be an element of procedural generation?<ul><li>Levels/rooms with different word types (adjectives, nouns, verbs, etc)</li><li>Or a level could be a set of similar words, exploring the level is sort of like exploring a memory palace: words/enemies have specific locations, and there may be puzzles or barriers you have to cross</li></ul></li><li>Is there a place for items or power-ups that you can collect as you make your way through your language journey?<ul><li></li></ul></li></ul></span></p>
