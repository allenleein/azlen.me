                <p class="backlink-text">I'm currently using this technique to learn to write Chinese characters, which is very interesting because it involves transforming between visual and auditory information. For each character I will describe what it looks like and the strokes/components that are part of it, then its pronunciation and what it means, often I will also look through a few common words it is part of to get a better overall sense of the character. It is slow, perhaps 2 - 3 minutes per character/radical but The rate of learning is roughly proportional to the rate of forgetting, and so by taking your time with each you will likely remember for much longer after a single exposure.</p>
