            <p><span><strong>Introduction</strong><ul><li>"A growing body of research in cognitive science illuminates the physical and mental toll that bland cityscapes exact on residents. Generally, these researchers argue that humans are healthier when they live among variety or work in well-designed, unique spaces, rather than unattractive, generic ones. There might even be a potential link between mind-numbing places and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders. In one case, physicians have linked “environmental deprivation” to ADHD in children (Urist, J., 2016)"<ul><li>This is exactly echoes my own thoughts and the design direction for South False Creek creating a landscape of unique spaces <a class="external" href="<a class="internal" data-uuid="3qi6NHTq" href="/3qi6NHTq">Styles of the times: liberal and neo-conservative landscapes in inner Vancouver, 1968–1986 (David Lee, 1986" target="_blank">(Ley, 1986)</a></a>)</li></ul></li><li>"Our thoughts shape our spaces, and our spaces return the favour"<br>—Steven Johnson (Where do Good Ideas Come From)</li></ul></span></p>
        
            <p><span><strong>Research Questions</strong><ul><li>"How can philosophy of <a class="internal" data-uuid="E6qSuzoE" href="/E6qSuzoE">Heterotopia</a> help us design spaces that trigger positive emotions and inspire creativity and innovation in urban environments?"</li><li>"How might we apply the principles of heterotopia in a modern context? Can we re-create Heterotopic experiences in the existing urban fabric of our cities with the help of emerging technology?"</li></ul></span></p>
        
            <p><span><strong>Part I: Urban Sociology</strong><ul><li>"Urban sociology is the study of social life and interactions in urban areas"</li><li><h2>Questions</h2><ul><li>What kinds of approaches exist for studying urban sociology?</li><li>What mental frameworks are helpful for studying and thinking about social life and interactions?<ul><li><a class="internal" data-uuid="FnSofJVE" href="/FnSofJVE">A framework for structuring thought is also a framework for asking good questions</a>—a mental framework with which to think about urban sociology will enable me to ask better questions to lead to more meaningful answers</li><li>I think first of my <a class="internal" data-uuid="fg3gS4pq" href="/fg3gS4pq">Δ Psychocivic framework for thought</a>, however perhaps this framework itself can be improved. For example, I do not have much of a consideration for time. As well it requires connecting the dots, it does not achieve the simplicity of some mental frameworks or lenses with which to look upon the world.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fazlen%2FkR9OscdsFS.png?alt=media&token=35fe5eac-d0a8-4ab7-88f8-3dc68189c8ab" alt="1" /></li><li>Architecture as an "event space" (Scott Mcquire)<ul><li>View that architecture creates space that social interactions and events can be organized</li><li>This event space is becoming digitalized and streamed across the globe<ul><li>How does this affect how we interact?</li><li>How does this affect the spaces that were meant for social interaction?</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>"Experience  = Space + Story (narratives)"<ul><li><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fazlen%2F7A9NGze627.png?alt=media&token=ccba2017-b85b-473b-9948-ac9c1a8a53b6" alt="1" /></li><li></li></ul></li></ul></span></p>
