        <h1>Notes on: Toward Renewable Assessments (David Wiley, 2016)</h1>
        
            <p><span>Interesting concept of "disposable assessments": papers or other assessments that are thrown away once given a grade. I had not encountered this term before.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>The opposite, "renewable assessment" would then be something which creates value or gets released into the world in some form that other people might find useful.<ul><li>Tells people: your work matters; disposable assessments tell us that it doesn't, you are never given a taste of making a small difference on the world or your local community</li></ul></span></p>
