            <p><span>Engagement is an active loop of participation, or conversation with a medium. <a class="internal" data-uuid="mGB7thFQ" href="/mGB7thFQ">Games are inherently engaging mediums</a> because they create create active participation. Conversely books and television tend to be primarily immersive mediums (<a class="internal" data-uuid="S3HUSUaw" href="/S3HUSUaw">Immersive mediums replace thought</a>) which do not require active participation.</span></p>
        
            <p><span><a class="internal" data-uuid="FnSofJVE" href="/FnSofJVE">A framework for structuring thought is also a framework for asking good questions</a>, so to create a model for thinking about what makes something engaging would help to ask deeper questions about how we interact with different mediums and how new mediums can be created and evolve to foster more active participation.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>My personal model for engagement involves <a class="internal" data-uuid="V42qDrst" href="/V42qDrst">Three engagement factors</a>: goal, space, and tools. At least two of these engagement factors must be present simultaneously to create an engaging experience; and each pair comes together to form the <a class="internal" data-uuid="nJHwBEjP" href="/nJHwBEjP">Three approaches to engagement</a>: puzzle, exploration, and curiosity.</span></p>

                <p class="backlink-text">This idea stems out of my concept around a Δ Model of engagement, and from this example of a group with divergent goals we could use this model to explore different potential Types of learning groups</p>

                <p class="backlink-title">Types of learning groups</p>
                <p class="backlink-text">Through facilitating a set of Learning Groups I have discovered that my hypothesis that Collective artifacts structure collaborative learning and engagement to be not entirely true and that Artifacts might not be the right framing for collective output. The reason for this is that the participants of the groups have divergent goals, which means that providing a goal of creating a single artifact is counter-intuitive. This leads me to consider how my Δ Model of engagement can be applied to understanding the different types of learning groups:</p>
