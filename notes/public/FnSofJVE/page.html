        <h1>A framework for structuring thought is also a framework for asking good questions</h1>
        
            <p><span>Good questions are more important than answers. From good questions arise good answers. And a framework for thinking helps to develop and come up with new questions. Take this note-taking system for example: I must structure my thought around densely interconnected notes and through this new questions emerge at the intersections.</span></p>
        
            <p><span>The goal of my <a class="internal" data-uuid="fg3gS4pq" href="/fg3gS4pq">Δ Psychocivic framework for thought</a> was to design a new way to think about the design and architecture of cities through a psychological perspective, and in designing a framework for thinking about the psychology of cities, it has also become a framework for asking pertinent questions. </span></p>

                <p class="backlink-text">Our cities affect our psychology. Exactly in what ways living in cities affects our mind and behaviour however is not clear. I think that we do not have a good mental framework for thinking about the psychological effects of cities so I have designed what I call the psychocivic framework for thought. A framework for structuring thought is also a framework for asking good questions.</p>

                <p class="backlink-text">A framework for structuring thought is also a framework for asking good questions, so to create a model for thinking about what makes something engaging would help to ask deeper questions about how we interact with different mediums and how new mediums can be created and evolve to foster more active participation.</p>
